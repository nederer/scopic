Hello!
Since I used Django, I used its built-in templating language as the basis for the fronted. It's easy and convenient.
Also, I have implemented several Api using DRF and output information via Ajax requests in a static file.
I used Celery + Redis for task queues. Celery Flower was used to keep track of the Celery states.
I found Sqlite3 as a lightweight database to be a good option for this test task. But it will be better to use PostgreSQL.
Wrapped everything in Docker for a convenient start

Once again I want to note that I will also be glad to consider the positions of Junior Web Developer in your company, since at the moment my knowledge in the front may not correspond to Midlle's position


Thank you!
